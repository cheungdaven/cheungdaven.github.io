<!--[Curriculum Vitae](files/Shuai_Curriculum.pdf). -->

I am currently employed at Amazon Web Services AI, focusing on foundation models related research, opensource projects, and products. Before this role, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), under the guidance of [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/). I received a PhD degree from the school of computer science and engineering of [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/homepage/), advised by [Prof. Lina Yao](https://www.linayao.com/), and my PhD study was also supported by [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/en/)'s Data61 PhD Scholarship. I obtained a Bachelor degree from Nanjing University. 

My primary areas of focus include LLMs, multimodal foundation models, information retrieval, graph machine learning, etc. I am a recipient of the [Best Paper Award runner-up](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2020/#:~:text=WSDM%202020%20Best%20Paper%20Award,Seshadhri.) at WSDM 2020, the [Outstanding Paper Award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab) at ICLR 2021, and the [Best of the Best conference Paper Award](https://shuaizhang.tech/images/gmc_best_paper_award.jpg) at the Global Marketing Conference ([GMC](https://2023gmc.imweb.me/)) 2023. I have served as the area chair for NAACL 2024, area chair for [WiML](https://sites.google.com/view/wiml2022/home) (Women in Machine Learning) Workshop at NeurIPS 2022, senior PC for IJCAI 2021 and CIKM 2021, session chair for CIKM 2021, and guest editor for Frontiers in Big Data. At Amazon, I have contributed to projects such as [Amazon Titan](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/), [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/), [D2L](https://d2l.ai/), and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). My research has garnered attention from the media, including coverage by outlets like [Australian Fintech](https://australianfintech.com.au/raiz-invest-partners-with-unsw-to-power-rewards-with-machine-learning/).
