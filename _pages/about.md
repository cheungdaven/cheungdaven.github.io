<!--[Curriculum Vitae](files/Shuai_Curriculum.pdf). -->


I am now at Amazon Web Services AI working on deep learning related research, opensource projects, and products. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the department of computer science at ETH Zurich, where I was advised by [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://zhangce.github.io/). I received my PhD degree from the school of computer science and engineering of the University of New South Wales, advised by [Prof. Lina Yao](https://www.linayao.com/). I obtained a Bachelor degree from Nanjing University.  

I am a recipient of the 
* [Best paper award runner-up](https://www.wsdm-conference.org/2020/#:~:text=WSDM%202020%20Best%20Paper%20Award,Seshadhri.) at WSDM 2020
* [Outstanding paper award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab) at ICLR 2021

<!--Hi, I am Shuai Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher at the department of computer science in ETH Zurich. I received my PhD degree in computer science from UNSW Sydney and a bachelor degree from Nanjing University. My primary research interests lie in recommender systems, knowledge graphs, graph related applications, etc. My past internships were with Amazon AI and Tencent. I have won the ICLR 2021 outstanding paper award and best paper award (runner-up) at WSDM 2020. His research interests include but not limited to recommender systems, knowledge graph, and deep learning. He is PC member and reviewer for a number of top conferences and journals. You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=PPjdxlcAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am a contributor for the following opensource projects: <br>
