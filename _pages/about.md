<!-- Shuai Zhang is a Postdoctoral Researcher at <b>ETH Zürich</b>, advised by [Ce Zhang](https://www.ds3lab.com/members/ce-zhang/). I received my PhD from the school of computer science and engineering at the <b>University of New South Wales </b> in 2019, where I was advised by [Lina Yao](http://www.linayao.com/), [Xiwei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9IUq78AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Liming Zhu](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~limingz/home/). During my PhD study, I interned at <b> Amazon AI </b> (Mentor: [Aston Zhang](https://www.astonzhang.com/)) and <b>Tencent</b>. I received a Bachelor degree in 2014 from <b>Nanjing University</b>. -->

Shuai Zhang is a postdoctoral researcher in the department of computer science at ETH Zurich, where he works with [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html). He received his PhD in computer science from the University of New South Wales, under the supervision of [Prof. Lina Yao](https://www.linayao.com/). His current research lies in geometry-oriented representation learning and its applications in information filtering, knowledge graph completion and reasoning. He is a recipient of the outstanding paper award at ICLR 2021 and the best paper award runner-up at WSDM 2020.

You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=PPjdxlcAAAAJ&hl=en). If you’d like to know more about my work or explore opportunities for collaboration, please get in touch!
