<!-- Shuai Zhang is a Postdoctoral Researcher at <b>ETH Zürich</b>, advised by [Ce Zhang](https://www.ds3lab.com/members/ce-zhang/). I received my PhD from the school of computer science and engineering at the <b>University of New South Wales </b> in 2019, where I was advised by [Lina Yao](http://www.linayao.com/), [Xiwei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x9IUq78AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Liming Zhu](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~limingz/home/). During my PhD study, I interned at <b> Amazon AI </b> (Mentor: [Aston Zhang](https://www.astonzhang.com/)) and <b>Tencent</b>. I received a Bachelor degree in 2014 from <b>Nanjing University</b>. -->

Hi, I am Shuai Zhang, a postdoctoral researcher at the department of computer science in ETH Zurich. I received my PhD degree in computer science from UNSW Sydney and a bachelor degree from Nanjing University. My primary research interests lie in recommender systems, knowledge graphs, graph related applications, etc. My past internships were with Amazon AI and Tencent. You can find my publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=PPjdxlcAAAAJ&hl=en). If you’d like to know more about my work or explore opportunities for collaboration, please get in touch!
